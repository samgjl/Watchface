# Watchface
Created as a gift for my partner. This project is not particularly well-commented.
This repository is a stylized implementation of the Web Watch from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.
## Implementation:
- Uses Kivy -- a GUI library for Python.
- `watchface.py` is the main file for the program.
